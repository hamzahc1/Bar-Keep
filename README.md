# Bar-Keep

The intention of this app is to let people search for bars in any cities in the world and then save their favourites so that they can have a global favourites list, with the ability to view all the bars on a map.

Bars are searched by using the Yelp API with a location search, favourited bars are then stored using MongoDB. They are rendered back to the user as a list and also on a map using Google Maps API.
